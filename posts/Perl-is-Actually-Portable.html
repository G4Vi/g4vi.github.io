<h1 id="TITLE" style="padding-bottom: 0">Perl is Actually Portable</h1>
<small><time>November 15, 2022</time> by Gavin Hayes</small>
<p>After stumbling upon Gautham's <a href="https://ahgamut.github.io/2021/07/13/ape-python/">APE Python port</a> and seeing how far along the <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan#cosmopolitan">Cosmopolitan Libc</a> has come along, I was inspired to see what it would take to port my scripting language of choice, Perl, to the Cosmopolitan Libc and turn it into a self-contained binary. My motivation came from wanting to prove that if Python can do it, Perl can do it too, wanting a more robust Windows Perl port for running my personal media server (MHFS), and the cool factor of hacking on Perl and the Cosmopolitan Libc.</p>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Cosmopolitan Libc allows building Actually Portable Executables: statically linked binaries that will run on six operating systems + BIOS. Perl is written in C. What could we do with an Actually Portable Executable version of Perl? A sysadmin managing a fleet of Red Hat and Windows boxes could start using the latest (and identical) version of Perl across all machines without compiling several different builds of Perl. It could be packaged into a Software Development Kit for easily getting Perl and accompanying scripts onto developer machines. A Perl application developer could increase reach and reduce support burden by also offering a binary release.</p>
<p>Making this vision a reality required some tinkering and development. There were a few gaps in the Libc functionality as the Cosmopolitan Libc is still a relatively new C library, having been in development for a little over two years. To build Actually Portable Executables, the Cosmopolitan Libc breaks some of the rules and conventions held by other libcs. Unlike building with most libcs, the Cosmopolitan Libc is not bound to a compiler. I will discuss addressing such issues below.</p>
<h2 id="Building Perl with the Cosmopolitan Libc">Building Perl with the Cosmopolitan Libc</h2>
<p>After cloning the Perl source, the next step was generating a proper build config with <code>Configure</code>. <code>Configure</code> is not generated by GNU Autotools, but by Perl's own configuration generator generator, <code>metaconfig</code>, originally written by Larry Wall himself. Modelling after an early version of the Python port, I made a <code>superConfigure</code> script to invoke <code>Configure</code> with the flags needed to build with Cosmopolitan. Unfortunately, just because flags were passed in, didn't mean <code>Configure</code> had to use them. In particular, <code>libs</code> were applied to the build config, but weren't used in most places for <code>Configure</code>'s own testing. Building for the Cosmopolitan Libc requires passing a large incantation of flags to <code>gcc</code> as it isn't bound to the C compiler. Edits aren't supposed to be made directly to <code>Configure</code>, but a patch file or <code>metaconfig</code> changes could be done later. Modifying <code>Configure</code> to always pass <code>libs</code> wasn't difficult, it just had to be done in a few places:<br><span><code>$cc -o try $ccflags $ldflags try.c <span class="ncode">$libs</span></code></span></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, after the first <code>Configure</code>, the build failed. The compiler errored out from missing headers. Initially this was fixed in two ways, preventing <code>Configure</code> from finding non-Cosmopolitan headers and adding dummy (empty) header files to it and <code>gcc</code>'s search path. All the needed libc symbols were already being passed to <code>gcc</code> as the <code>ccflags</code> directly <code>-include</code>d the <code>cosmopolitan.h</code> amalgamation header. However, <code>Configure</code> and the Perl build depend on the libc header files being available. Using the amalgamation header ultimately proved to be problematic, but the dummy headers seemed like an easy fix at this time. <code>Configure</code> checked for availability of certain libc symbols by creating test programs that declared them and then testing if the programs compiled. To accommodate the symbols already being included by the amalgamation, the symbol test was patched to not declare the symbol, just use it:</p>
<code class="dcode">$extern_C void *$1$tdc; void *(*(p()))$tdc { return &$1; }</code><br>
<code class="ncode">void *(*(p()))$tdc { return (void*)&$1; }</code><br>
<p>Perl itself also sometimes declared libc symbols which lead to conflicting types errors. Temporarily, it was fine to comment out the declarations as <code>cosmopolitan.h</code> already contained them.</p>
<pre><code><span class="ncode">//</span>Uid_t getuid (void);
<span class="ncode">//</span>Uid_t geteuid (void);
<span class="ncode">//</span>Gid_t getgid (void);
<span class="ncode">//</span>Gid_t getegid (void);</code></pre>

<p>After the last change, miniperl built! Perl programmers often prefer to write Perl to <i>sh</i> so Perl is built with Perl! To not have a chicken-and-egg situation making it difficult to port Perl to new platforms, the first thing built is <code>miniperl</code>, Perl without C or XS extension modules that can be used to assist with building the rest of Perl.</p>

<p>To reduce dependence on the <code>superConfigure</code> script and make building Perl for Cosmopolitan less different from building Perl for other platforms, a <code>hints</code> file was created, <code>hints/cosmo.sh</code>. Once a platform is detected or set in <code>Configure</code>, it loads in the corresponding settings to ease building Perl for a platform.</p>

<h3 id="Passing make minitest">Passing <code>make minitest</code></h3>

<p>Basic functionality appeared to work under miniperl, but <code>make</code> had failed and it suggested running <code>make minitest</code>, a subset of tests that can be ran on <code>miniperl</code>. For a first run <code>make minitest</code> wasn't too bad: <b><code>Failed 95 tests out of 339, 71.98% okay.</code></b> However, it was alarming that a crash in miniperl that kept popping up</p>

<code>
libc/zipos/find.c:34: assert(ZIP_CFILE_MAGIC(zipos->map + c) == kZipCfileHdrMagic) failed
</code>

<p>Fortunately, it was an easy fix; the <code>Makefile</code> in addition to building ELF executables like usual, needed to use <code>objcopy</code> to create APEs or Actually Portable Executables. <code>zipos</code>, Cosmopolitan's internal ZIP filesystem fails to load on non-APE binaries. <code class="ncode nowrap">objcopy -S -O binary _miniperl miniperl.com</code>. <code>make minitest</code> ran a lot better after switching to the APE and a couple more <code>Configure</code> tweaks: <b><code>Failed 13 tests out of 357, 96.36% okay.</code></b></p>

<p>Removing the stack protector from the Perl build resolved the additional crashes. <code>gcc</code>'s stack protector isn't compatible with the Cosmopolitan Libc. Adding <code>-fno-stack-protector</code> to the <code>ccflags</code> stopped <code>Configure</code> from enabling it.
<b><code>Failed 12 tests out of 359, 96.66% okay.</code></b></p>

<p>Failure to load the <code>Errno</code> module caused several of the <code>minitest</code> failures. The <code>Errno</code> module is a pure Perl module, however it is generated from parsing C headers and output from the C preprocessor. Due to Cosmopolitan wanting to be as thin of a wrapper as possible, the "constants" depend on the currently running operating system and thus must be determined at runtime. The constants for the unix-like platforms are in <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/master/libc/sysv/consts.sh"><code>consts.sh</code></a>. Therefore, the "constants" couldn't be simply hard-coded to integer values in <code>Errno.pm</code>. The solution was to make a C extension (<a href="https://github.com/G4Vi/perl5/blob/cosmo-perl-v5.37-plus-dontuse/ext/ErrnoRuntime/ErrnoRuntime.xs"><code>ErrnoRuntime</code>)</a> <code>Errno</code> can use to load the current values; however, that didn't solve the problem of <code>Errno</code> not working for miniperl because miniperl doesn't include the C extensions as it is used to build the extensions. To work around this in order to test the rest of the modules and build the rest of Perl, I setup <code>Errno.pm</code> to have the current (build-time) constants for use under miniperl only.</p>

<p>In the midst of the <code>Errno</code> patches, I switched away from using the amalgamation header, <code>cosmopolitan.h</code> to use Cosmopolitan's <code>libc/isystem</code> directory as that removed the need for dummy headers and stopped everything from being included all the time, fixing the incompatible declarations errors.</p>

<p>Improving and adding to the Cosmopolitan Libc fixed the remaining <code>make minitest</code> failures. Perl's massive test suite did a pretty good job of alerting to issues before encountering them in normal use. Working on something as base as a libc is exciting as you get to see how the sausage gets made and the opportunity to make some high-impact contributions to open source as your code may be used in thousands of programs.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/pull/532">utimesat: stop zipos case from interfering with futimens operation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/pull/539">Stop sys_lseek from truncating return value to 32 bits</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/pull/546">setlocale: Add fake support for locale=""</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A variety of headers in <code>libc/isystem</code> were also improved to include the required Cosmopolitan headers to match Perl and Linux's expectations for the headers.</p>

<h3 id="Building Full Perl">Building Full Perl</h3>

<p>After <code>make minitest</code> passed, Perl could be linked together, but without several core standard extensions. As seen with the issues with <code>Errno</code>, Cosmopolitan's "constants" did not work in all the places the constants were used due to the "constants" not being compile-time integer values.</p>

<p>Several extensions relied on <code>ExtUtils::Constant</code> to generate the glue code necessary to retrieve the constants to make them available to Perl. <code>ExtUtils::Constant</code> generated <code>static const</code> arrays containing the necessary constants. To instead generate code compatible with Cosmopolitan's "constants", <code>const</code> was dropped from the array type and the "constants" were removed from the array: removed items in red:</p>

<pre><code>static <span class="dcode">const</span> struct iv_s values_for_iv[] =
      {
#ifdef AF_INET
        { "AF_INET", 7<span class="dcode">, AF_INET</span> },
#endif
#ifdef AF_INET6
        { "AF_INET6", 8<span class="dcode">, AF_INET6</span> }
#endif
      };</code></pre>
 
<p>Additional code was generated to fill-in the array at runtime:</p>

<pre><code class="ncode">unsigned i = 0;
#ifdef AF_INET
values_for_iv[i++].value = AF_INET;
#endif
#ifdef AF_INET6
values_for_iv[i++].value = AF_INET6;
#endif</code></pre>

<p>The newly generated code is fragile as the constant setup is now split between multiple places and the order of the constant assignment code must be maintained to match with the order as initialized in the array. The generated code should never be edited manually, so it should be good enough for now.</p>

<p><code>Fnctl</code> and <code>IO</code> were fixed by the <code>ExtUtils::Constant</code> changes.</p>

<p><code>POSIX</code>, in addition to the <code>ExtUtils::Constant</code> changes, required temporarily disabling some Cosmopolitan unimplemented functions and casting a function to the right signature. Later, the incompatibility was fixed in Cosmopolitan and these hacks were removed.</p>

<p><code>Socket</code> in addition to the <code>ExtUtils::Constant</code> changes, required switching away from using "constants" in places that required the values to be known at compile time. <code>inet_ntop</code>'s output buffer was changed to use a size large enough for all platforms instead of a platform-dependent constant. <code>switch</code> statements that included <code>case</code>s with the "constants" had to be switched to <code>if</code> statements.</p>

<p>Now, all the extensions built and the same process for <code>make minitest</code>: test, fix, retest, was done for <code>make test</code> . Adding to and improving Cosmopolitan fixed many of the test failures. Much of this was random <i>POSIX</i> functionality such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/pull/583/files/1aaf7ca99eeb75dd57d470264b145b82ad588ee8"><code>inet_pton</code> IPv6 address parsing</a></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="Building Actually Portable Perl (APPerl)">Building Actually Portable Perl (APPerl)</h2>

<p>With a fairly functional Perl, it could now be turned into APPerl. Perl's cross-compiling facilities and Cosmopolitan's ZIP filesystem made this process not too tricky.</p>

<p>Files stored in the internal ZIP file can be accessed just like normal files via <code>/zip</code>, a magic path that maps to the ZIP compressed files. Much of the Libc has special handling for it, though it's read-only and cannot be directly <code>exec</code>ed from.</p>

<p>Similar to <code>prefix</code> with <code>autoconf</code>, <code>Configure</code>'s <code>prefix</code> sets the install directory. Setting <code>prefix</code> to <code>/zip</code> configured Perl to read modules from the ZIP filesystem. Actually installing to <code>/zip</code> on disk, however, would be inconvenient. Running <code>make install</code> with the <code>DESTDIR</code> variable alleviated that concern as instead files would be installed to <code>DESTDIR/prefix</code>, but Perl would still be configured to <code>prefix</code>.</p>

<p>After the <code>make install</code>, APPerl was made just by adding the contents of <code>DESTDIR/zip</code> to the APE Perl binary as it is also a ZIP file.
<code>zip -r "perl.com" "lib" "bin"</code>. After removing the unneeded <code>perl</code> executable in <code>bin</code>, <code>bin</code> only contained perl scripts, not binaries. For example, <code>perldoc</code> embedded in the binary can be launched with <code>./perl.com /zip/bin/perldoc</code></p>

<h3 id="Getting perldoc working on Windows">Getting <code>perldoc</code> working on Windows</h3>

<p>One of Perl's strengths is that it has a large amount of high-quality official and unofficial documentation available. To not starve APPerl users of it, it was critical to make sure it works right at the terminal like usual.</p>

<p>Looking at <code>Perldoc.pm</code> it was discovered that <code>perldoc</code> works by generating a pod(Plain Old Documentation) document, writing it to disk, and using shell-invoking <code>system</code> to launch a pager and open the document.</p>

<p>Fortunately, one of the pagers <code>perldoc</code> attempts to use, <code>more</code>, actually exists on Windows too, so an alternative viewing method was not needed. However, shell-invoking <code>system</code> was broken on Windows as unix builds of Perl use <code>sh</code> for shell-invoking <code>system</code> usage. Perl was switched to use <code>cmd.exe</code> when running on Windows. <code>IsWindows</code> is a runtime check on the currently running operating system from the Libc. Cosmopolitan even has some automatic conversion from unix to Windows filepaths in the <code>argv</code> to command line translation.</p>

<pre><code class="ncode">#ifdef __COSMOPOLITAN__
#    include "libc/dce.h"
#endif
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="ncode">#ifdef __COSMOPOLITAN__
if(IsWindows())
{
    PerlProc_execl("/C/Windows/System32/cmd.exe", "/C/Windows/System32/cmd.exe", "/c", cmd, (char *)NULL);
}
else
#endif
{</code><code>
    PerlProc_execl(PL_sh_path, "sh", "-c", cmd, (char *)NULL);</code><code class="ncode">
}
</code></pre>

<p>A better solution for cross-platform <code>system</code> is available in the Cosmopolitan Libc: using an embedded command interpreter function (<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/b850b14300f112c238debf441746ef9ff93e8dba/libc/runtime/cocmd.c#L660"><code>cocmd</code></a>) instead of <code>exec</code>ing a seperate binary for the shell. The main advantage of using <code>cocmd</code> instead of the current platform's shell is portability. Traditionally, using <code>system</code> portably across operating systems, especially between Windows and unix was near impossible due to varying command interpreters with incompatible syntax. Using the same command interpreter everywhere gets rid of that compatibility headache. Migrating APPerl's <code>system</code> to use <code>cocmd</code> is on the near to-do list. Since the full build of Perl actually depends on shell-invoking usage of its <code>system</code>, the migration cannot occur until a few more <code>sh</code> differences are resolved. </p>

<h3 id="argv[0] script execution"><code>argv[0]</code> script execution</h3>

<p>Most programs ignore <code>argv[0]</code> as their program name isn't relevant to execution. However, it can be used to dispatch just like any of the other arguments. Trying to come up with an easier way to launch <code>perldoc</code>, I remembered a technique used by <a href="https://busybox.net/FAQ.html#source_applets">BusyBox</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/pp#DESCRIPTION"><code>PAR::Packer</code></a>, use <code>argv[0]</code> to determine what program to run. APPerl tests the basename of <code>argv[0]</code>(with extension stripped) against the scripts in <code>/zip/bin</code>. If it exists, it runs said script. This feature allows accessing <code>perldoc</code> with a symlink: <code>ln -s perl.com perldoc</code> and can be used for other scripts, enabling making single binary Perl applications. <a href="https://github.com/G4Vi/perl5/commit/9719db2dfbb19454177a31d8ce874a61f17a30da#diff-f4fcf861484a0d159aeef20b3d0c409a33f3bbad83b1447eae6e4d514878caae">Patch to <code>perl.c</code></a> to enable <code>argv[0]</code> script execution.</p>

<h2 id="The APPerl Perl distribution">The APPerl Perl distribution</h2>

<p>Rather than releasing a lone binary as a demo and calling it done, it seemed apt to turn APPerl into a Perl distribution. By Perl distribution, I am referring to a binary distribution of Perl such as Strawberry Perl, ActiveState Perl, or how Perl is released via various package managers.</p>

<p>With some work, the <code>cosmo</code> platform may be able to get merged into the official Perl source, but the modifications and additions needed to turn Perl into APPerl are ill-suited for the <code>perl5</code> source. Following the model of Strawberry Perl, I created a package for building APPerl, <code>Perl::Dist::APPerl</code>.</p>

<p><code>Perl::Dist::APPerl</code> is made up of <code>apperlm</code> (APPerl Manager) and accompanying documentation. <code>apperlm</code> is used for building APPerl and includes creating and switching build configs.</p>

<p>The full build of APPerl (all standard modules, extensions, and docs) came out to under 24 MiB. To provide a lighter-weight version, the <code>small</code> config was developed and came out to under 5 MiB. Debian's list of files in <code>perl-base</code> was helpful for understanding what would be a decent subset for the <code>small</code> config. Unfortunately, during the process of creating APPerl, Cosmopolitan Libc dropped support for Windows Vista and 7 as it was too difficult to support them as they do not have a true 64-bit address space. <code>vista</code> configs were created to still create APPerl for those OSes. The <code>vista</code> configs use a community fork of Cosmopolitan to still provide compatibility.</p>

<p>The full potential of APPerl lies on how it's used. APPerl building into a single portable cross-platform binary could make it ideal to include in an development SDK. <code>apperlm</code> is tailored to building custom builds of APPerl to package apps. Thus, it can allow you to create single binary releases of your Perl application. Perl is no longer a second-class citizen to languages that build to binaries, so it's more viable to use for users unable or unwilling to install Perl. Building Perl from source is not a requirement of an APPerl app, <code>nobuild</code> configs are supported, allowing you to base your app off of an existing version of APPerl such as one of the official releases. APPerl can also ease the transition to newer Perl versions as deploying or switching out one binary is a lot easier than installing a whole tree of files.</p>

<h3 id="Dogfooding"><a href="https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MS.2006.72">Dogfooding</a></h3>

<p>To verify APPerl was ready for external use, it is now used for binary releases of two of my projects: <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/PlayStation::MemoryCard"><code>psx_mc_cli</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/G4Vi/MHFS#mhfs---media-http-file-server"><code>MHFS</code></a>. </p>

<p><code>psx_mc_cli</code> is a set of PlayStation MemoryCard file utilities. As expected it wasn't a very tricky port with it only having one non-core dependency, however attempting to make the smallest possible version with its perldoc documentation required some trial and error. To ease creating minimal applications, the "-" prefix was implemented in <code>apperlm</code> to remove from the config set instead of replacing, a counter-part to the "+" prefix for appending to a config set. An <a href="https://github.com/G4Vi/psx_mc_cli/blob/f2ce8c2793cdc15525f91730c0ae76260961d8f0/psx_mc_cli">install script</a> was created to create symlinks or fallback to renamed copies of the binary to ease access to the embedded tools. <a href="https://github.com/G4Vi/psx_mc_cli/blob/f2ce8c2793cdc15525f91730c0ae76260961d8f0/apperl-project.json"><code>apperl-project.json</code></a></p>

<p><code>MHFS</code> tested out a larger subset of APPerl as it is an HTTP media server. The APPerl port mainly required figuring out how to include the dependencies in APPerl. Perl itself was able to build and install the <code>HTML-Template</code>, <code>URI</code>, and <code>Class-Inspector</code> distributions once they were copied to the <code>cpan</code> directory. <code>File::ShareDir::Install</code> was not included as MHFS's static files could just be added to <code>zip_extra_files</code>. The <code>App-MHFS</code> distribution and <code>File::ShareDir</code> module were installed via copying from <code>zip_extra_files</code> as their <code>Makefile.PL</code>'s had extension module dependencies (<code>IO</code> and <code>Time::HiRes</code>), making them unbuildable by <code>miniperl</code>. After building, MHFS initially hung when handling some HTTP requests, however it wasn't from APPerl, but from a regression introduced attempting to clean up the socket code. Upon reverting the offending change, it worked as expected on Linux. Unfortunately, Windows compatibility isn't possible yet as Cosmopolitan doesn't support <code>fcntl</code> <code>F_SETFL</code> on Windows (needed to set <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> on the sockets), but I am confident it will be soon be added as Cosmopolitan's Windows polyfills (for <code>fork</code>, etc) have been spectacular. The recommended dependency <code>MHFS::XS</code> was not added yet as <code>libFLAC</code> must be ported to Cosmopolitan first. <a href="https://github.com/G4Vi/MHFS/blob/c23ff7e6995f6bb47e8c56185ae7d84602c8d731/apperl/apperl-project.json"><code>apperl-project.json</code></a></p>
